This program calculates fragmentation statistics about the ext2 file system.
The meaning of reported numbers is explained in the accompanying man-page
which may be formatted with the following commands:

  groff -Tascii -mdoc ext2frag.1 | more

(try using nroff if you don't have groff).

BUILDING
========

You need to have installed cmake (www.cmake.org), boost (www.boost.org) and
libext2fs library (part of e2fsprogs) and corresponding development packages.
The following procedure builds the program:

  $ cmake .
  $ make

The ext2frag program is left in the working directory.  The configuration
procedure looks for the necessary libraries only in standard places:
/usr/{include,lib} and /usr/local/{include,lib}.  If you have packages
installed at other places, the configuration will fail.  In that case, edit
the CMakeLists.txt file and repeat the steups above.

TODO
====

  - discover the reason of discrepancy in free block numbers

Some ideas for future enhancements:

  - calculate fragmentation data also for directories
  - separate calculation for metadata
  - more selective output
